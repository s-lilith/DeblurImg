# DeblurImg
The deblur problem consists of reconstructing an image from an acquired data using the following model: b = Ax + η
where b represents the corrupted image, x the original image we want to reconstruct, A the operator applying the Gaussian blur and η the additive noise with Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and standard deviation σ.
